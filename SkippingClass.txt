My heart, I never be, I never see, I never know
My heart, I never be, I never see, I never know

Yeah, I'm done skippin' classes with you, fuck them drugs (ok is the hardest, I swear to God)
Fuck them grades, I made her ass bigger (we gon' be okay)
Yeah, I'm done skippin' classes with you, I was done being bad with you
Fuck class, drew a bad pic, they on my dick because I swag diff'
I swear to God, if you had a torch, you'd be in last with it
Like, who you is? Like, comin' in with codeine
She want me to hit, she said, "Let me live"
Like, come on, twin, we can't all get in
Like, we can't all get in, like
This ain't that, you out of swag with it (swag with it)
In the classes, fuckin' mad bitches (mad bitches)
Fuck that class and drew a bad picture (bad picture)
Drank cup, poppin-pop-poppin' tags with it
And I'm so obsessed with sad bitch, you, you
Bad, ain't no second guessin', bad, bad, bad
Bitch, just bring whatever, I just want whatever chopper
Pushin' buttons, choppers, you was lookin' for my llama, llama
Bad-ass bitch, she flawless, she wanna stalk me 'cause I'm poppin'

Yeah, I'm done skippin' classes with you
I was done being bad with you
Fuck class, drew a bad picture

Yeah, I'm done skippin' classes with you, fuck them drugs (ok is the hardest, I swear to God)
Fuck them drugs (we gon' be okay)
